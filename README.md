# TDD  (Solver)
Implementation of TDD for mobile application of Solver


If you are not familiar with linters and GitHub Actions, read [root level README](../README.md).

## Set-up linters in your local env

### [RuboCop](https://docs.rubocop.org/en/stable/)

1. Add this line to the `Gemfile`
    ```
    gem 'rubocop', '>= 1.0', '< 2.0'
    ```
    *not sure how to use Gemfile? Read [this](https://bundler.io/v1.15/guides/bundler_setup.html).*
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Copy [.rubocop.yml](./.rubocop.yml) to the root directory of your project
4. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**
    - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.
5. Run `rubocop`.
6. Fix linter errors.
7. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: feel free to research [auto-correct options for Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_correct/) if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!
